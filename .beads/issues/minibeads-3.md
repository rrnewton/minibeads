- âœ… Clippy checks passing
- âœ… E2E test infrastructure complete
- âœ… Shell-based e2e test with 28 assertions (basic_operations.sh)
- âœ… Rust test harness for automatic shell test discovery
- âœ… GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configured
- ðŸ”² Need more comprehensive test coverage
- ðŸ”² Need additional e2e scenarios

## TODO

- [ ] Add code coverage reporting

## Completed
- [x] Created tests/basic_operations.sh with 28 test assertions
- [x] Created tests/e2e_tests.rs Rust harness
- [x] Integrated with cargo test

  - Linting (fmt + clippy)
  - Security audit (cargo-audit)
  - Cross-platform testing (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
