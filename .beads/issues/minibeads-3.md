# Description

Track testing improvements for minibeads.

## Current Status
- âœ… 3 unit tests passing (format, lock)
- âœ… Makefile with validate target created
- âœ… Clippy checks passing
- âœ… E2E test infrastructure complete with auto-discovery
- âœ… Shell-based e2e tests: 64 total assertions
  - basic_operations.sh: 36 assertions (core commands)
  - help_version.sh: 28 assertions (help/version/quickstart)
- âœ… Rust test harness for automatic shell test discovery
- âœ… GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configured
- âœ… Phase 1 test porting complete (see minibeads-14)
- ðŸ”² Need Phase 2 unit tests for edge cases
- ðŸ”² Need Phase 4 MCP integration tests

## TODO
- [ ] Add more unit tests for storage operations
- [ ] Add more e2e test scenarios (concurrent access, error handling, edge cases)
- [ ] Add property-based tests for markdown format
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting
- [ ] Implement test porting plan from upstream beads (see minibeads-14)

## Completed
